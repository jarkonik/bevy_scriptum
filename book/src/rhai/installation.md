# Installation

Add the following to your `Cargo.toml`:

```toml
[dependencies]
bevy = "0.13"
bevy_scriptum = { version = "0.5", features = ["rhai"] }
```

If you need a different version of bevy you need to use a matching bevy_scriptum
version according to the [bevy support matrix](../bevy_support_matrix.md)
